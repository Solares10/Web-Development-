                    <p class="artist-name">RENAISSANCE</p>
                    <p class="description">
                        The Renaissance was a period of cultural rebirth that began in Italy during the late 14th century 
                        and gradually spread throughout Europe. The Renaissance marked a revival of interest in the classical art and ideas of ancient Greece and Rome
                        This era emphasized a departure from the medieval worldview,
                        with a renewed interest in the philosophies, art, and scientific advancements of ancient Greece and Rome. 
                        Humanism, which emphasized the potential of human beings, became a central theme, 
                        and artists started to focus on realism, anatomy, and perspective. 
                        The development of linear perspective and techniques like chiaroscuro (the treatment of light and shadow) 
                        allowed for more lifelike and three-dimensional representations.
                        This was a period of great change, as new ideas challenged medieval religious views, 
                        and artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael produced iconic works that highlighted human experience, emotion, and the beauty of nature.

                    <p class="artist-name">BAROQUE</p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Baroque art emerged in the early 17th century to mid-18th century (1600 - 1750), 
                        primarily in Italy, and spread across Europe, 
                        particularly in response to the Catholic Church's Counter-Reformation. 
                        The movement sought to inspire awe and emotion, using dramatic and grandiose elements 
                        to convey religious and political power. 
                        Baroque artists embraced intense contrasts of light and shadow (chiaroscuro), vibrant colors, and dynamic compositions 
                        to evoke movement and tension. The style was often associated with the grandeur of monarchy and the church, 
                        reflecting the political and religious turmoil of the time. Artists like Caravaggio, 
                        with his bold use of light and realistic portrayals of religious scenes, and 
                        Peter Paul Rubens, with his energetic compositions and use of color, 
                        embodied the dramatic and emotional qualities of the Baroque period. 
                        The Baroque movement also reflected the era's focus on conflict, power, and the divine.

                    <p class="artist-name">ROCOCO</p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Rococo, also known as Late Baroque, emerged in France during the early 18th century (appox. 1600 - 1725)and 
                        was characterized by a lighter, more playful, and decorative style compared to the earlier Baroque movement. 
                        This period coincided with the reign of Louis XV and reflected the lavish lifestyle and indulgence of the French aristocracy. 
                        Rococo art focused on themes of love, nature, and whimsy, often featuring soft pastels, intricate details, and asymmetrical compositions. 
                        Unlike the grandeur and drama of Baroque, Rococo was designed to be more intimate and sensual, 
                        with an emphasis on elegance and pleasure. Artists like François Boucher, 
                        known for his sensual depictions of mythological subjects, and Jean-Honoré Fragonard, 
                        whose works like The Swing captured moments of flirtation and romance, epitomized the frivolity and decadence of the Rococo era. 
                        The movement gradually fell out of favor as the French Revolution loomed and new artistic ideals began to take hold.

                    <p class="artist-name">NEOCLASSICAL</p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Neoclassicism was an movement in the mid-18th century to early 19th century (approx. 1750 - 1830) 
                        as a response to the ornate excesses of the Rococo style and as part of a broader cultural movement 
                        towards rationality and order. It was inspired by the rediscovery of classical art and architecture in ancient Greece and Rome, 
                        particularly after the excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum. 
                        The movement emphasized simplicity, symmetry, and the virtues of ancient civilizations, focusing on moral themes and heroism. 
                        In an age of political revolutions, Neoclassical artists turned to themes of patriotism, virtue, and civic duty. 
                        The works of Jacques-Louis David, such as The Death of Socrates, exemplify the Neoclassical interest in portraying stoic, 
                        heroic figures with rational compositions and idealized forms. 
                        Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, another prominent Neoclassical artist, focused on precise lines and calm, composed figures, 
                        reflecting the period's reverence for clarity and order. 
                        The Neoclassical style aligned with the Enlightenment ideals of reason, individualism, and the pursuit of knowledge.

                    <p class="artist-name">ROMANTICISM </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Romanticism emerged in the late 18th century as a reaction against the rationalism of the Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution. 
                        It emphasized emotion, imagination, and the sublime, often glorifying nature, individualism, and the power of human emotion. 
                        Romantic artists rejected the strict rules of Neoclassical art and instead sought to express intense feelings, 
                        whether through dramatic landscapes, historical events, or personal experiences. 
                        The movement was deeply connected to political and social change, with many Romantic works serving as a protest against the effects of industrialization 
                        and the loss of the natural world. Artists like Francisco Goya, whose works such as The Third of May 1808 depicted the horrors of war, 
                        and Eugène Delacroix, known for his passionate and vivid scenes such as Liberty Leading the People, 
                        aptured the emotional depth and turbulent spirit of the Romantic period. 
                        The movement championed freedom, individual rights, and a deep connection to nature.

                    <p class="artist-name">REALISM</p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Realism developed in the mid-19th century (approx. 1840 - 1880) as a response to the idealized depictions of Romanticism and the academic standards of Neoclassicism. 
                        Realist artists rejected the exaggeration of emotion and the dramatic focus of earlier movements, 
                        instead choosing to depict life as it truly was. 
                        This meant focusing on everyday scenes, particularly those involving the working class, rural life, and ordinary people. 
                        Realism arose during a time of social change, including the Industrial Revolution and political upheavals, and sought to reflect the realities of modern life, 
                        often highlighting social injustice, poverty, and the struggles of the lower classes. 
                        Gustave Courbet's The Stone Breakers and Jean-François Millet's The Gleaners are iconic examples of Realist art, 
                        capturing the dignity and hardships of laborers. Realism emphasized objective observation and detailed representation, 
                        making it a powerful tool for social commentary.

                    <p class="artist-name">IMPRESSIONISM</p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Impressionism began in France in the 1860s as a revolutionary movement that broke away from the traditional academic art standards. 
                        The name "Impressionism" was coined after Claude Monet's painting Impression, Sunrise, 
                        and it was initially used mockingly. However, the artists embraced the term, which reflected their aim to capture fleeting moments of light and atmosphere. 
                        Rather than focusing on fine details, Impressionists used loose brushwork and bright, often contrasting, colors to suggest the impression of a scene. 
                        They frequently painted outdoors (en plein air) to capture natural light, and their subjects ranged from everyday life to landscapes and scenes of modern Parisian life. 
                        Artists like Monet, with his series of water lily paintings, and Edgar Degas, who portrayed dancers in motion, captured the vibrancy and movement of the world around them. 
                        Impressionism marked a significant shift away from the realism of earlier movements and was an early precursor to modern art.
